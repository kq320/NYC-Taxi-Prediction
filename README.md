# NYC-Taxi-Prediction
Predicting the Number of NYC Taxi Pick-ups by Zip Code

The primary objective of this project is to predict the number of Yellow and Green taxi pickups in each zip code, by the hour of the day and the day of the week.

The second objective was to find the optimal machine learning prediction model by comparing different models results.

We split the processed data into training data and split data, with 60% of the data as training data and 40% as the test data.
